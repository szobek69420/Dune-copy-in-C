# Hello there

This project is a simple remake of the mobile game called "Dune!".
It will most probably not be very aestheticly pleasing.

If for some reason you want to open the source project, the VS solution is configured in x64 mode.

Currently it looks like nothing less than a demonstration of the capabilities of modern graphics hardware.
